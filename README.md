# Project description
This project is a mod for game "Lethal Company". It's written with the help of BepInExPlugin, and it's posted on thunderstore community website.

It's purpose is to let players sell store-bought items for 50% of their original price

Items can't be collected as scrap, so they don't count in overall value at the end of each round/day

# Future plans
Make mod compatible with mods that add items to store

Add config for scanNode parameters, price fee (default 50%), etc.

# Bugs
 none for now
