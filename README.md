# Project description
This project is a mod for game "Lethal Company". It's written with the help of BepInExPlugin, and it's posted on thunderstore community website.

It's purpose is to let players sell store-bought items for 50% of their original price

Items can't be collected as scrap, so they don't count in overall value at the end of each round/day

## Introduction
You bought whole lot of equipment for you and your crew, but as the deadline approaches, you're falling short of meeting your quota?

##### This mod is for you!

### Features:
+ **scan** store-bought items to see their name and price   
  
+ **sell** store-bought items at company building and get *credits* and *quota progress*!  

  + items are sold for **50%** of their price, including discounts

### Warning
This mod is not fully tested. I appreciate any help

### Noticed issues
- Sometimes you can't scan items when they're outside of the ship

- If item was bought for 140 but delivered on the day when its price was at 200 - then it will cost 200
